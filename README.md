# Trip Mines!

Yeah, that's pretty much it. Trip mines! You hit the laser beam, you explode.

I've been using these mines on my server for quite a long time, which means they're pretty balanced straight out-of-box.

# Features
* *are dangerous to everyone!* Yes, you will blow up even if you're a traitor
* *can be placed almost anywhere*, unless you're planning to put it on a prop
* *are scannable by detectives*, revealing traitors' fingerprints
* *configurable*! Adjust the damage, beam length, blast radius, activation time and more to your needs
* *are visible in your hands*. No, that person didn't kill you for no reason
